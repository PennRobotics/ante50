This program generates, compares, and displays Texas Hold'em hands for a table
of 2 to 10 players, all while recording hand statistics. There is no player
input or betting in this version of the program.

## TODO

In addition to fixing the inline TODO tags, the next step is to **transfer bet chips into the correct pot (main or side) and award each winning hand from the pot **

(This is a reasonably large undertaking, but half of what is needed is already there.)
